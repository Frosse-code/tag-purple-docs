## Tip #1 Positioning the phone
Generally hold the back of the phone to the NFC tag so that it is 0-2cm from the surface. Experiment with the best position of your phone against the tag. For example Apple Iphones will be somewhere near the back top edge of the phone while Google Pixel phones will be somewhere near the very middle of the back of the phone.

## Tip #2 Reathentication schedule
You will need to re-authenticate your mobile number every 30 days. This is normal.

## Tip 
Your signin will only persist for 30 days for subsequent taps on the same device, using the same browser, in normal mode (ie not private/incognito mode).
