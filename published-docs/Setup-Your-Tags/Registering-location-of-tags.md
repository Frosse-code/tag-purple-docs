## Receiving your tags

Your NFC stickers will arrive in the post within 48 hours of ordering.

## Sticking tags
You may wish to stick the sticker on to pre-printed sheets of paper/stickers that will provide context for the tag to the end user.

Alternatively, stick tags directly onto walls or assets.

Tags should be difficult to remove and treated as a long-term fixture to represent the location. But they can easily be replaced in future.

## Distributing tags
A single tag in each location will often be sufficient. But more than one tag can be associated with a single location to provide resiliency or concurrent usa
Ideally, each tag will be located:
- Where it is easy to see and tap with a phone
- On a surface it adheres well to (avoiding metal)
- Within mobile/wifi data coverage

## Registering tags
Once you have stuck it, tap it!

If a tag is tagged that hasn't been registered to a location yet, then a tap will prompt you the adminsitrator to assign a location.
