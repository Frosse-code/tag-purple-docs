## Receiving your tags

Your NFC stickers will arrive in the post within 48 hours of ordering.

## Deciding what to adhere them to
You may wish to stick stickers directly onto walls or assets. Alternatively, stick the sticker on to pre-printed sheets of paper that will provide users context for the NFC tag

Choosing where to stick 'em

Here are some tips on where to locate your tags
- Avoid metal
- Somewhere there is mobile signal
- Uncovered

Once you have stuck it, tap it.
If a Tag Purple is tagged that hasn't been registered to a location yet, then a tap will prompt you the adminstrator to assign a location.
