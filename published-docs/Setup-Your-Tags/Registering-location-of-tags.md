## Receiving your tags

Your NFC stickers will arrive in the post within 48 hours of ordering.

## Deciding what to adhere them to
You may wish to stick tags directly onto walls or assets. Alternatively, stick the sticker on to pre-printed sheets of paper that will provide users context for the tag.

## Distributing tags
Ideally, your tag will be located:
- Where it is easy to reach
- Where a phone can comfortably be positioned over
- Away from metal surfaces
- Somewhere there is mobile signal
- Uncovered

Once you have stuck it, tap it.
If a Tag Purple is tagged that hasn't been registered to a location yet, then a tap will prompt you the adminstrator to assign a location.
