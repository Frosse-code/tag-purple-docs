## Receiving your tags

Your NFC stickers will arrive in the post within 48 hours of ordering.

## Deciding what to adhere them to
You may wish to stick tags directly onto walls or assets. Alternatively, stick the sticker on to pre-printed sheets of paper that will provide users context for the tag.

## Distributing tags
Ideally, each tag will be located:
- Where it is easy to see and tap with a phone
- On a surface it adheres well to (avoiding metal)
- Within mobile/wifi data coverage

Once you have stuck it, tap it.
If a Tag Purple is tagged that hasn't been registered to a location yet, then a tap will prompt you the adminstrator to assign a location.
