Your signing will only persist for 30 days for subsequent taps on the same device, using the same browser, in normal 
If a subsequent tap asks you to signing again soon after making a previous tap, you may have:
- Changed your default browser
- Somehow loaded the tap into a different browser
- Left your browser in "incognito" mode, also known as "private" mode
