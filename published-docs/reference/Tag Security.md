## About the tags
TagPurple tags are a type of NFC tag that have a clever security feature.
Each time a tag is tapped, a counter is incremented and a cryptographic signature is generated from a key on the tag, using the tags unique identifier and the current counter as inputs.
In this way, every tap can be verified as a unique real tap on a known TagPurple tag, registered by you to one of your locations.

## Confidence in the data

### Tapper
Before any user can tap-in, they must authenticate by following a link sent to them in an SMS message. This authentication process generates a session that will be usable for 30 days, before they must repeat the authorisation. In this way, the phone number is used as the unique identifier for the tapper.
Therefore, in-as-much as SMS is secure and access to that phone isn't shared, you have strong evidence for who the tapper was.
### Location
Assuming confidence in the tags inability to move location, this security gives reasonable confidence that the TagPurple tag was really tapped at the registered location.
