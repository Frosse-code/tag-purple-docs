Choosing where to stick 'em

Here are some tips on where to locate your tags
- Avoid metal
- Somewhere there is mobile signal
- Uncovered

Once you have stuck it, tap it.
If a Tag Purple is tagged that hasn't been registered to a location yet, then a tap will prompt you the adminstrator to assign a location.
